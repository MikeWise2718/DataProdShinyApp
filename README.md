DataProdShinyApp
================
# 
# A rather silly app (server.R) to fulfill the Data Products shiny app requirement

#
# To run ensure that a ui.r and a server.r are in the directory
# and the shiny library is installed and loaded into the session
# with "library(shiny)"
# then change to that directory in R-studio 
# and invoke the function "runApp()" or
# runGitHub("DataProdProject","MikeWise2718")
